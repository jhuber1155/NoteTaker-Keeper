# NoteTaker-Keeper

## Description

This project was created to help the end user organize their busy work schedule with an easily managed task organizer. This will allow the end user to quickly and easily add tasks to their daily regiment which will help them stay on task and focused on their goals. This build emphasized the skills I learned about modularization, routing, and using get, post, and delete requests to organize and manipulate the server side of the full stack develpment.

## Installation

The user can see the deployed application on the Heroku hosting site or download the code from the GitHub repository.

If you choose to download from GitHub, you will need to go to the repository page, clone the code, open the code editor of your choice and then open the integrated terminal. The end user will need to install the npm packages "express" and "uuid". They can either add them manually or install them using the command `npm i` in their integrated terminal. Run the code `node server.js` to open your localhost server. Then open a browswer window and type localhost:3001. From there, you should be able to open the webpage and follow the instructions for writing a new note.

## Usage

This is fairly straightforward, once you open the browser, the welcome page will present with a button to start making a note.

 From there Click on the title section to create a note title. Then enter your note in the text area below. Click on the save button to save the note, otherwise you can click on the clear form button to delete your current note. If you click save, it will save the note on the lefthand side of the screen. If you have finished your task, or no longer wish to do that task, you can click on the red trashcan next to the saved note to delete it from the list of notes. You can click on New Note to start a new note whenever you wish.
